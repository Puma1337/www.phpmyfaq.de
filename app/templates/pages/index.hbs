                    <p>
                        Today we relaunched our website. In the last couple of weeks we decoupled our almost 14 year old
                        website into variuous side projects to improve the maintainability of our infrastructure. The
                        new page is completely revamped from the ground and was developed with the "mobile first"
                        paradigm in mind.<br>
                        The new page is built using Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, Assemble and Handlebars, more and more content
                        is just stored just as plain Markdown files. It's a static site which will be "assembled" during
                        deployment. We also improved our URL structure. We hope, you like it. If you want to check the
                        code, it's open source, grab it <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phpMyFAQ/www.phpmyfaq.de">at Github</a>,
