The phpMyFAQ Team would like to announce the availability of [phpMyFAQ 2.9.0-beta2](/download), the "Lemmy Kilmister"
release. This release adds support for Elasticsearch and we added new mobile first, touch-friendly default layout. We
also added a JSON export and a simple bash based backup script. We fixed a lot of issues reported from our beta testers.
Please note that you shouldn't use this version in production systems, but test this version and please report bugs!
