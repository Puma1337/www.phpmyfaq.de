The phpMyFAQ Team is pleased to announce the first preview version of the next major version of phpMyFAQ, 
[phpMyFAQ 2.9.0-alpha2](/download), the "Je suis Charlie" release. This release adds experimental support for the 
upcoming PHP 7 and for HHVM 3.4.2+. We added the possibility for inactive, hidden categories, to disable registration 
and we added a tag management frontend. We added a control for meta robots handling, a configuration for auto-activation 
of new users and finally support for SMTP. We upgraded the bundled libraries to Symfony ClassLoader 2.6.3, jQuery 
1.11.2, Bootstrap 3.3.2, FontAwesome 4.3.0, Modernizr 2.8.3, TinyMCE 4.1.7 and SwiftMailer 5.3.1. Please note that some 
functionality is still missing and don't use this version in production systems, but test this version and please report 
bugs!

Today we relaunched our website. In the last couple of weeks we decoupled our almost 14 year old website into variuous
side projects to improve the maintainability of our infrastructure. The new page is completely revamped from the ground
and was developed with the "mobile first" paradigm in mind.
The new page is built using Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, Assemble and Handlebars, more and more content is just stored 
just as plain Markdown files. It's a static site which will be "assembled" during deployment. We also improved our URL 
structure. We hope, you like it. If you want to check the code, it's open source, grab it <a rel="nofollow"
