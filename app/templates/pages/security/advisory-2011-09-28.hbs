                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.6.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        phpMyFAQ 2.6 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request to a .php
                        file, which reveals the installation path in an error message, e.g. by lang/language_uk.php and certain
                        other files.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.6.18 which fixes these vulnerabilities. All
                        users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest
                        version.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Workaround</h2>
                    <p>
                        There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.6.18.
