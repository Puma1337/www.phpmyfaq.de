                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our
                        bundled ImageManager library we use in phpMyFAQ 2.6 and 2.7.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        The bundled ImageManager library allows injection of arbitrary PHP code via POST requests.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.6.19 and 2.7.1, which incorporates a
                        fixed bundled ImageManager library. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to
                        upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Workaround</h2>
                    <p>
                        There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.6.19 and phpMyFAQ 2.7.1.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Credits</h2>
