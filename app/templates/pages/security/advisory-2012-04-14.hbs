                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our bundled
                        ImageManager library we use in phpMyFAQ 2.7.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        The bundled ImageManager library allows injection of arbitrary PHP code to execute arbitrary PHP
                        code and upload malware and trojan horses.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.7.5, which incorporates a fixed bundled
                        ImageManager library. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon
                        as possible to this latest version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Workaround</h3>
                    <p>
                        There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.7.5.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Credits</h3>
