                    <p>The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 1.5.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        All vulnerabilities are exploitable by an anonymous user. All vulnerabilities are exploitable, no matter
                        if magic_quotes_gpc is turned on or off. The "thema", "username" and "usermail" parameters are prone to
                        cross-site scripting attacks in the "add content" page.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.5.4 which fixes these vulnerabilities. All users
                        of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Workaround</h2>
                    <p>There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 1.5.4.</p>

                    <h2>Credits</h2>
