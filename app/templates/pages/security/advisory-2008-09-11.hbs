                    <p>The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        phpMyFAQ relies on code similar to Popoon's externalinput.php to filter out potential XSS attacks on
                        user-supplied input. This filter, and the original, fail to fully sanitize user data. In particular,
                        this filter fails to protect against '/'s acting as spaces in both Microsoft Internet Explorer and
                        Mozilla Firefox.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.0.8 which fixes these vulnerabilities. All users
                        of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Workaround</h3>
                    <p>There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.0.8.</p>
