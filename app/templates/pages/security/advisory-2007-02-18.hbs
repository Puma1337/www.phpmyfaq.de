                    <p>The phpMyFAQ Team has learned about a vulnerability in the code that could be exploited in phpMyFAQ
                        1.6.x.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Through the vulnerability it is possible to gain the privilege for uploading files on the server when
                        register_globals is activated: currently no public exploit is available but some users already reported
                        us to be hacked and the <strong>r57shell</strong> script has been installed on their systems.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 1.6.10 which fixes the vulnerability. All users
                        of the affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest
                        version.</p>

                    <h3>Workaround</h3>
                    <p>If it's possible for you set register_globals to off in your php.ini configuration settings.</p>

                    <h3>Credits</h3>
                    <p>The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank François Maillet and Enrico Fischer (Powerserver-Germany
                        webHosting & DomainServices) for reporting the vulnerability, and Johannes Schlüter for discovering and
                        fixing the issue.</p>
