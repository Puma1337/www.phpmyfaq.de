                        <p>
                            The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our bundled library
                            XML-RPC we use in phpMyFAQ 1.4 and 1.5.</p>

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP
                            code via an application using the vulnerable library.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Impact</h3>
                        <p>
                            This issue allows for possible remote code execution.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.4.9 and 1.5.0 RC5, which incorporate a fixed
                            bundled library XML-RPC. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
                            possible to this latest version.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Workaround</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a temporary hotfix you can delete your xmlrpcs.php and xmlrpcs.php file in the directory inc/so that
                            your FAQ will not easily allow execution of maliclius XML-RPC method calls.
                        </p>
