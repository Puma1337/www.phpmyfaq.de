                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned about some vulnerabilities in the code that could be exploited in
                        phpMyFAQ 1.6.x.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through one of the vulnerabilities it is possible to gain the privilege for uploading files on the
                        server: currently no public exploit is available but two users already reported us to be hacked and
                        the <strong>r57shell</strong> script has been installed on their systems.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 1.6.8 which fixes these vulnerabilities. All
                        users of the affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest
                        version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Workaround</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the time of this advisory there's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 1.6.8.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Credits</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Markus Kohlmeyer, for reporting us how his system has been
                        hacked, and Stefan Esser, for discovering all the other vulnerabilities.
