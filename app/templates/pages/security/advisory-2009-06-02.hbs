                    <p>The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.0.x</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        phpMyFAQ doesn't sanitize the error message in the admin login page. In case of a "bad login" attempt
                        with a properly crafted URL it is f.e. possible to inject HTML code into the output of the error
                        message, which could result in the leakage of domain cookies (f.e. session identifiers).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.0.15 which fixes the vulnerability. All users of
                        affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Workaround</h3>
                    <p>There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.0.15.</p>

                    <h3>Credits</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Jan Hertsens and Rick G. Elliot (LiveOps Inc) for reporting the
                        vulnerability.
