                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a possible SQL injection vulnerability in phpMyFAQ version 1.4 and
                        1.5.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        phpMyFAQ lets public users add FAQ records to the database. The records will be saved into the database
                        but aren't visible by default.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        Input passed to the username field in forum messages isn't properly sanitised before being stored.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.4.7 and 1.5.0 RC2, which incorporate a fix for
                        the SQL injection vulnerability. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade to
                        this latest version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Workaround</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is no workaround except installing the new version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Credits</h3>
                    <p>
                        The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Sven Michels of sectoor GmbH for discovering this SQL injection
                        vulnerability.
